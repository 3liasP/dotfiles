# Personal Dotfiles for Linux Systems

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This collection stores my personal configuration, particularly on Arch Linux with the Sway tiling window manager / compositor. However, these dotfiles might be compatible with other Linux distributions and tiling managers like i3, so you can adapt them to suit your preferences and system setup.
